<b>Fundamental theorem of arithmetic.</b><br>
The crucial importance of <b>prime numbers</b>  to number theory <br>
and mathematics in general stems from the <u>fundamental</u> <br>
<u>theorem of arithmetic</u>, which states that<br>
<b>every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one<br>
or more primes in a way that is unique except for the order <br>
of the prime factors. </b>>[3]
<br>Primes can thus be considered the "basic building blocks" of the<br>
natural numbers. For example:<br>
<b>23244	= 2 &#1832 ∑ &#183 ∑ 13 ∑ 149= 2<sup>2</sup>> ∑ 3 ∑ 13 ∑ 149.</b>> <br>
(2<sup>2</sup> denotes the square or second power of 2.)<br>
<br>
As in this example, the same prime factor may occur multiple times. <br>
<br>
A decomposition: n = p<sub>1</sub> ∑ p<sub>2</sub> ∑ ... ∑ p<sub>t</sub> of a number n into (finitely<br>
many) prime factors p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ... to p<sub>t</sub> is called prime factorization of n.
